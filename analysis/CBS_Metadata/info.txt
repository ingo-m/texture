Control experiment, with two conditions in separate runs.

(1) A light grey texture square presented on a dark texture background. The
    texture of the background and of the light grey square was identical, only
    the luminance differed. In other words, this condition tests for the effect
    of luminance, keeping texture constant. The area of the central bright
    square is matched to the area of the Pac-Man (in the Pac-Man study).

(2) In the second condition, a uniform dark grey background constituted the rest
    condition. The stimulus was a full-screen, dark grey texture pattern with
    the same mean luminance as the uniform rest condition. In other words, this
    condition tests for an effect of texture, irrespective of luminance.

The analysis pipeline is largely adapted from control experiments 20181128
and 20190207 (some aspects may be redundant).
